	<p class="pHeading">how it started</p>
	<p>
	I was fourteen and obsessed with making music, set on turning it into  my career. I learned how to play guitar and convinced a bunch of my friends in my school to start a band with me. We ended up playing at a few events but none of my bandmates cared as much as I did. They started focusing on other things that high school students generally care about. Left to realize my dream of becoming a full time musician on my own, I started looking for other alternatives. That's when I discovered FL Studio.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I remember downloading the trial version of the software and playing around with the drum sequencer. I was blown away by how it was possible to make a beat without a human drummer. I could just keep the drum beats looping in the background while I played my guitar and sang. I could then record the whole performance and share on YouTube. But soon the trial version expired, my laptop broke and I got busy with school. I never really went all the way to make videos of me playing music on youtube. Looking back, the process of setting up all the equipment, to be able to make a song was actually a lot of work. Balancing school work and everything else, it was impossible to make time, no matter how much I cared about music.

	<p class="pHeading">impact of the internet</p>
	<p>
	The internet is really good at blurring the lines between creators and consumers. From writing and taking photos to making films, anybody can create new things and reach anyone. You don't need to go to college for 4 years and major in "Tweeting" -  all you need is a phone and an internet connection to put your rawest thoughts on the internet. You don't need to go to a film school to learn to make duets on Tiktok, in the words of the great Casey Neistat - all it takes is a phone, an internet connection AND A GOOD IDEA.
	</p> 

	<p>
	But when it comes to music, there's still a hard distinction between who a musician is and who a listener is. While platforms like Soundcloud let anyone upload a song, making a song IS STILL HARD. Spend a lot of money buying music production software. And then weeks if not months just learning how to use this software
	</p> 

	<p>
	Streaming music services are also designed for consumption instead of creation. The creation experience doesn't even exist. If tiktok simplified and enabled video editing within it's app, there's no reason for music editing to not exist in a music consumption app.
	</p> 

	<p class="pHeading">what's changing in music</p>

	<p>
	In the last few years, there's been a shift in who the "stars" of music are. Musicians who could sing, rap, and play guitar always held the spotlight. However, in the recent years, there's a new kind of musician that's emerging. It's the solo producer. Artists like Flume, Skrillex, Martin Garrix, Alison Wonderland have millions of fans and these artists mainly work on music production software like FL Studio, Ableton, Logic Pro, etc. Their software is their instrument. Just like how 14 year old me was able to conjure up a software drummer while I played guitar, musicians can now create entire solo productions on their laptops, sitting in a hotel room or on a plane.
	</p> 

	<p>
	I remember going through another phase in college where I considered music seriously. Bought some studio monitors, spent $200 to purchase logic, and started publishing songs on Soundcloud. I spent most of my time trying to learn the basics of how to use Logic and never really graduated to figuring out my own unique sound as a producer. Eventually, I got more obsessed with building apps instead of making songs so I stopped.
	</p> 

	<p>
	While music software has managed to eliminate the need for an entire studio, the software itself is still hard to use for every day users. For example, it takes 5 steps to add a reverb effect on Ableton. Plus it's also very expensive. You and I who don't necessarily want to win a grammy or become the next Travis Scott can't just put together a few sounds and express ourselves via sound. This creates a barrier to entry for making music.
	</p> 

	<p class="pHeading">what needs to change</p>

	<p>
	Firstly, music production has to be dead simple, almost as intuitive as taking a photo. If adding a simple effect such as a pitch change or a reverb effect takes 5 steps, most of us aren't going to have the patience to learn it. Unless we're sufficiently motivated to do so. And one way to go about making dead simple is by focusing on a specific use case. Then expanding to adjacent use cases from there. Making tiktok mashups immediately comes to mind. There are probably a myriad of other use cases as well.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Secondly, music production and consumption has to be deeply social. Current platforms are very isolating and don't involve people in our life in any meaningful way. Listening experiences are cold and isolated experiences. Whenever I put on my headphones to listen to music I always end up shutting off the external world.
	</p> 

	<p>
	A social graph would be beneficial for creators as well as it would enable immediate feedback loops. It would also help creators start accumulating reputation from their music skills. It would be a place to build their community/following/fan base. Making something social also supercharges discovery.
	</p> 

	<p>
	Thirdly, remixing with appropriate attribution has to be a core part of how music is produced. It solves the classic cold start problem, where you don't have to start with a blank canvas when creating something new instead you can build on other people's creativity. Remixing allows a song to become a starting point for another song. This reduces the barrier to start making songs. Enabling more people to start creating their own songs easily.
	</p> 

	<p class="pHeading">future implications of change</p>

	<p>
	Remixing gives rise to mimetic music creation. Where sounds get built on top of other sounds and end up setting off social trends. Just like video, image and text memes are copied with slight variations are spread around the internet, giving rise to meme culture, remixing can give birth to an entirely new musical meme culture. Allowing everybody to participate and make a contribution in their own unique way. This could also change music from an art form to a medium for communicating information.
	</p> 

	<p>
		A social graph and the ability to build on top of other's creative work could also enable a new kind of creator economy. Long tail artists would be able to sell their tracks to other artists. It would be a form of asynchronous collaboration to produce finished songs. This currently exists on internet via websites like Beat Stars. Lil Nas X for example, bought a beat on beatstars for $30 from a random producer in Amsterdam. All he had to do next was add vocals on the track. Imagine if you could buy a track, add vocals and share it, all on one app. The entire world of buying beats would now be made accessible to new and upcoming artists.
	</p> 

	<p>
		As a senior at NYU, I remember taking a music class as an elective and meeting a lot of other students  who were doing the music thing full time. I was overcome with regret and felt that if these people could do it, I could do it as well. But I had chosen not to. Being surrounded peers who had similar goals made me think that my wild dream of becoming a musician was possible after all. If I had access to that scene when I was 14, perhaps things would have turned out differently. A new music platform could enable such scenes to move to the cloud where they can flourish and complement existing physical locations.
	</p> 

	<p>
		There are a lot of hotspots of musicians geographically in LA, Nashville, Atlanta, and New York. In scenes, people collaborate and compete with each other. They build on each other's work leading to an explosion of creativity and culture. A lot of these scenes are also moving virtual via platforms like discord. I'm already in a lot of music discords where artist share their tracks, talk about things happening in the industry and network with each other. Basically a virtual version of LA without the beaches of course.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Ultimately, tools and platforms that democratize access and let anybody create end up being very valuable. Shopify, airbnb, YouTube, tiktok are valuable primarily because they've created new markets by letting an entire new segment of the population to become merchants, hosts, creators and filmmakers. Any company that democratizes music production tools would have a similar effect and change the entire music industry as we know it.
	</p> 

	<p>
		And that's why we're working on Bounce.
